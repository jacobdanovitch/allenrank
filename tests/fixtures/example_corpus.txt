Attention is a technique for attending to different parts of an input vector to capture long-term dependencies. Within the context of NLP, traditional sequence-to-sequence models compressed the input sequence to a fixed-length context vector, which hindered their ability to remember long inputs such as sentences. In contrast, attention creates shortcuts between the context vector and the entire source input. Below you will find a continuously updating list of attention based building blocks used in deep learning.
Convolutional Neural Networks are used to extract features from images, employing convolutions as their primary operator. Below you can find a continuously updating list of convolutional neural networks.
BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, improves upon standard Transformers by removing the unidirectionality constraint by using a masked language model (MLM) pre-training objective. The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike left-to-right language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pre-train a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addition to the masked language model, BERT uses a next sentence prediction task that jointly pre-trains text-pair representations.
A Transformer is a model architecture that eschews recurrence and instead relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. Before Transformers, the dominant sequence transduction models were based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The Transformer also employs an encoder and decoder, but removing recurrence in favor of attention mechanisms allows for significantly more parallelization than methods like RNNs and CNNs.
Seq2Seq, or Sequence To Sequence, is a model used in sequence prediction tasks, such as language modelling and machine translation. The idea is to use one LSTM, the encoder, to read the input sequence one timestep at a time, to obtain a large fixed dimensional vector representation (a context vector), and then to use another LSTM, the decoder, to extract the output sequence from that vector. The second LSTM is essentially a recurrent neural network language model except that it is conditioned on the input sequence.
A Graph Convolutional Network, or GCN, is an approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data. It is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs. The choice of convolutional architecture is motivated via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. The model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes.
